# Jeppy's PickaxeVault
Here is a collection of all of the swapped Default Pickaxe paks I could make/find. (Essentially free pickaxes for 5.10-6.10)
If you have one that is not in the repository, dm me at Jeppy#3076.
NOTE: I also split up the two folders due to multiplayer servers using 8.30 versions now. Good luck!
